# Nedz

Don't force autistic kids to change in a way to fit this world, but change this world in the way they can fit.

Nedz is a unique application that focuses on knowing what the autistic's needs are, it's not an educational app that aims to change them but accepts their changes. Our goal was to use AI and machine learning on autistic kids using voice recognition and photo labeling.

It can also detect the kid's emotions by counting the times of the emojis he chooses in the emojis category that is shown in the Data field.
Nedz can inform parents or caregivers what the kid chooses by sending an email for the thing he picked.

Thanks to the "One Step Forward" center for helping us by upgrading the idea with their experience & allowed us to deal with their autistic kids.
